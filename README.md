#Classroom Assembly

In childhood education, it is usual to perform the Classroom Assembly, where the children gather to discuss some aspects like weather, day of the week, or the agenda of the day.

This assembly takes special rellevance for people with special education needings, who require major stimulation than other children.

Classroom Assembly is an application to make it possible, so that children can perform the classroom assembly through a PDI and made it more participative, interactive and estimulating.

This application was developed in collaboration and advice of the CEE Miquel Burguera in Sueca(Valencia), in the context of an Educational Innovation and Research Project. More info at http://www.joamuran.net/piie/materials/assemblea/assemblea/.
